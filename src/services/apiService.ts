    summary: "This comprehensive tutorial covers JavaScript ES6+ features including arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, and modern best practices. The presenter explains how these features improve code readability and maintainability while reducing common errors. Several examples demonstrate practical applications in real-world scenarios.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Arrow functions provide shorter syntax and lexical 'this' binding",
      "Destructuring allows extracting values from objects and arrays more efficiently",
      "Async/await simplifies asynchronous code compared to promise chains",
      "Template literals improve string formatting with embedded expressions",
      "Modern module system helps organize code better than older approaches"
